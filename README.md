## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**NaradaThomas/NaradaThomas** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on his GitHub profile. This is his first ever respository and README.md file.

Excited for my journey I am taking alongside my other travels!

I am a British Columbia-based deaf designer specializing in content design, photography, information technology, accessibility, and data analysis. I like to wear many hats while advocating to protect our planet and make it more accessible. I value clarity, empathy, and integrity above all else. These ideals guide my approach to problem-solving and life in general.

I am currently finishing my Bachelor of Integrated Studies degree with double minors in Adult Education and Business at University of Fraser Valley, Abbotsford BC.

I hope to learn user experience, web design, javascript, and some programming concepts using Github Education and other resources.

I love eletronic dance music, outdoors, and technology!
